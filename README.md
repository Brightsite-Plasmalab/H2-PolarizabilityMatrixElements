# H2-PolarizabilityMatrixElements
Set of data and python programs for interpolation (of wavelength dependent polarizability) and computation of the matrix elements(for rovibrational states) within the ground electronic state.

This repository contains :
 - Internuclear distance dependent polarizability for molecualr hydrogen
 - Rovibrational wavefunctions for H2, HD and D2 for v=0--4 and J=0--10.
 - A python module which can be used to compute the wavelength dependent matrix elements. Wavelength range available is 182.5 to 1320.6 nm.
 
 To use the program follow the steps.
 1. Download the zip file and unzip it to a folder.
 2.
