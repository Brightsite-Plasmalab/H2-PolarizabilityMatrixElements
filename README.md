# H2-PolarizabilityMatrixElements
Set of data and python programs for interpolation (of wavelength dependent polarizability) and computation of the matrix elements(for rovibrational states) within the ground electronic state.

This repository contains :
 - Internuclear distance dependent polarizability for molecualr hydrogen
 - Rovibrational wavefunctions for H2, HD and D2 for v=0--4 and J=0--10.
 - A python module which can be used to compute the wavelength dependent matrix elements. Wavelength range available is 182.5 to 1320.6 nm.
 
 **Requirements**
 python3
 
 To use the program (in a UNIX environment or MS-DOS environment) follow the steps.
 1. Download the zip file and unzip it to a folder.
 2. Move to the unzipped folder on the console.
 3. Initialize python by `python3`
 4. Import the `sys` module and add the current folder to path allowing to import the module in the current folder.
    `import sys
     sys.path.append("..")`
     
 5.
