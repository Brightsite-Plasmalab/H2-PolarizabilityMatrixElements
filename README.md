# H2-PolarizabilityMatrixElements
Set of data and python programs for interpolation (of wavelength dependent polarizability) and computation of the matrix elements(for rovibrational states) within the ground electronic state.

This repository contains :
    - Internuclear distance dependent polarizability for molecualr hydrogen
    - Rovibrational wavefunctions for H2, HD and D2 for v=0--4 and J=0--10.
    - A python module which can be used to compute the wavelength dependent matrix elements. Wavelength range available is 182.5 to 1320.6 nm.
